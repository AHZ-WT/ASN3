          <img class="photography" src="images/photographypj.jpg" alt="wooden throne in the north carolina botanical gardens">
          <h3>Photography</h3>
          <p>I am a freelance photographer in my spare time.  While photography is mainly a hobby, I am available for hire.  Although I have had an opportunity to shoot weddings, portraits, and various other genres, I have found that my preferences are portrait photography, street photography, and nature.</p>
          <p>The image to the left is a wooden throne found in the North Carolina Botanical Gardens; it was one of the first images that I captured, but is still one of my favorites to this day.</p>
